# Restored Wave Spawner

A simple SCP:SL plugin that re-adds buttons to manually trigger respawn waves which were removed in a recent patch.

# Permissions
Player must have vanilla `RespawnEvents` permission to use the Spawn button. The settings options may appear to unprivledged players, but will not do anything.

# Installation
Choose either the LabAPI or EXILED build and place it in your respective Plugins directory.

_This plugin should only be needed temporarily until Northwood re-adds the menu._
